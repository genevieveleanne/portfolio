    <h1>The Call Center</h1>
    <h2>By Genevieve Leanne Dominguez</h2>
    <p>
      The soft ringing in my headset alerts me to an incoming call. “Good
      morning. This is Lena. You have reached Dr. Jill Arbor’s office. How may I
      help you?” I say. The soft click tells me the caller has disconnected.
      This happens often. I mark the call as a “Hang up”. Then I wait for the
      next call. After three minutes of waiting, I decide today must be a slow
      day. Is it because of the weather? My cubicle is near the floor-to-ceiling
      windows. I angle my chair to face the rain that’s unceasingly sliding down
      the panes. Thunder rolls and lightning flashes a few seconds later. ​ Our
      office is part of a 20--story building that rents spaces out. We’re on the
      twentieth floor and from what I’ve been told, the call center has been
      here for 20 years. I look down at the mass of umbrellas clamoring to get
      out of the rain. Some fold inward as their owners get into cars or taxis.
      Others duck under awnings or scurry into stores. Soft ringing in my ears
      grabs my attention. “Good morning. Lena speaking. This is the message
      service for attorneys Dan, Chester, and Donna. How can I assist you
      today?” ​ Heavy breathing. A beat of silence. Heavy breathing again. I
      repeat the answer phrase. The caller becomes quiet. Too quiet. “There is
      no response to me. I’m disconnecting,” I say. Click. The caller hangs up
      before I can. This happens somewhat often. Carol pokes her head out of her
      cubicle. “Almost break time. Want to join me?” ​ She’s a sweet older lady.
      We have the same breaks and lunch. Sometimes she asks me to join her.
      Other times, she talks to her grandkids. Whenever she asks me, I never say
      no. The break room is small but nice. To the left is a countertop filled
      with bagels, fruit, and trail mix packages. We also have an expensive
      coffee machine and an assortment of tea bags. To the right are more
      windows and a large TV that’s mounted to the wall. The news is playing,
      but the volume is turned down. 15 minutes goes by fast, so Carol and I
      either snack and talk or snack and watch the news. I take a sip of my
      coffee as she turns up the volume on the TV. “The search for Kelly has
      come to an end. The remains of the 23-year-old were found yesterday by
      police. When asked to comment, Chief Broward had this to say.” The screen
      changes from the youthful reporter to a fatigued older man standing behind
      a podium, facing a crowd of reporters and cameras. He clears his throat
      then begins to speak gruffly. “5 women have gone missing in the past
      month. 5 bodies were found. All the victims were in their twenties, and
      all of them looked alike. Based on the findings in our investigation, it
      is clear we have a serial killer on our hands.” Murmurs and gasps ripple
      through the crowd, but Chief Broward commands the attention back to him.
      “Do not underestimate this monster. Do not go out alone. Lock your cars,
      your doors, your windows. Double check the locks. Carry mace with you. And
      most importantly, do not answer a call from a number you don’t recognize.”
      This leads to a series of questions from the reporters. The chief answers
      some of them, saying that whoever is doing this likes to scare the victims
      over the phone before kidnapping them. The screen changes to display a
      photo of each victim before switching back to the original reporter. “This
      is terribly frightening. We haven’t had a serial killer on the loose in
      years,” Carol says. She looks at me concerned. “You look like them.” The
      unspoken words linger between us – the victims, she means. “We get off at
      5:30. I can call my dad to come by,” I say. She nods enthusiastically.
      “That sounds good. If you’d like, I can walk you to your car.” I don’t
      have it in me to tell her that the killer probably wouldn’t be scared by a
      sweet old lady like herself. Instead, I smile and say, “Thanks, Carol.”
      ….. The call comes right before lunch. “Good afternoon. Pond Path Crisis
      Center. How can I help you?” The caller’s voice is low and calm and raspy.
      “How is your day going?” I try to keep my voice cheery so he won’t detect
      that I’m a bit creeped out. “I’m fine, thank you. And yourself?” Click. I
      sigh in relief. I’m glad he hung up. We’re not allowed to disconnect the
      call just because the caller gives us the heebie-jeebies. What I heard on
      the news must still be in the back of my mind. The sky is just as dark as
      it was this morning, but the rain is pouring down harder than it was
      before. Being near the windows has its advantage. I close my eyes and
      listen to the rhythmic sound. I’m not worried about falling asleep because
      the light pressure of my headset and the telltale ring will gently remind
      me that I’m not at home. “Lena.” Oh no. ​ I jerk and open my eyes. It’s my
      boss, Aidan. ​ “I’m sorry. It’s a slow day. I was relaxing a bit,” I blurt
      out. He smiles. ​ “I didn’t call you out for that reason. I would like to
      discuss something with you. Would it be okay if we had lunch together?”
      Lunch with my boss. My cute boss. I hope no one thinks anything bad or
      starts gossiping… I don’t think they will. From what I’ve heard from my
      co-workers, Aidan is in his mid-thirties and single. Besides, we’ll be in
      the lunchroom with everyone else. ​ How can I say no? ….. “Your stats are
      great. Always have been. You’ve only called out twice in the past year,
      for which you provided doctor’s notes. In addition, our clients have given
      you compliments. I’d like to commend you on your hard work, Lena.” ​ I
      smile as I grab another forkful of salad. “Thank you.” ​ He shakes his
      head and takes a sip of his drink. “No, thank you. Given your performance
      and tenure, I would like to offer you a promotion.” ​ Oh, wow, I think.
      Now it makes sense. Why else would he want to have lunch with me? ​ “Yes,
      of course! Thank you!” I say. He chuckles. ​ “I’m glad you agree. I’ll
      announce it at the end of the month. The new pay period will begin then.
      I’d like you to have a smooth transition.” ​ He talks some more about the
      position. To sum it up, I’ll be his assistant. When he’s finished, he
      leans over and pats my hand. A handsome smile lights up his face. ​ “I’ve
      listened to some of your calls. I think you’re a very nice person. I’d
      like to keep you,” he says. I smile, unsure what to say. Thunder roars
      outside just then, making me jump. The lights overhead flicker then go
      out. A couple of people yelp in surprise. Cell phone flashlights turn on.
      Aidan stands and smooths his tie. “Everyone, I know it’s easier said than
      done, but please remain calm. I’m sure the power will come on soon.” I
      stand and head to the window with my phone flashlight guiding me. It looks
      like the entire city – or at least the block we’re on – is without power.
      Aidan stands beside me. Even in the eerie lighting, he’s still
      good-looking. “How long should we wait? I ask. “30 minutes, give or take,
      before I have to send everyone home. If that happens, I’ll walk you to
      your car,” he says. I start to tell him that won’t be necessary, but he
      politely cuts me off. “I want you to be safe, Lena. It’s dangerous out
      there.” He glances out the window and nods, as if he’s assessing
      something. “Too dangerous,” he murmurs. ….. After ten long minutes, the
      power comes back on. Aidan had ushered everyone back to their cubicles by
      then. As we wait for our equipment to turn on, Carol pokes her head out of
      her cubicle and asks me what happened during lunch. I tell her about my
      promotion. She beams. ​ “That’s wonderful! I’m proud of you, Lena. You
      deserve it.” ​ The call comes twenty minutes later. ​ “Good afternoon,
      Lena speaking. This is Mike’s HVAC and plumbing. How may I help you?” ​
      The caller’s voice is low and calm and raspy. “How is your day going?” ​
      It’s the same caller from earlier today. But he didn’t call a home service
      company the first time. Or did he? I can’t remember. I swallow hard. ​
      “I’m fine, thank you. And yourself?” I say. ​ “A bit lonely.” ​ “I’m so
      sorry to hear that. How can I assist you?” ​ We’re trained to offer
      empathy but discreetly direct the caller to remain focused on the services
      the company offers. In this case, he should need help with plumbing or his
      HVAC system. ​ “You’re so precious. I like how detailed your sticky notes
      are.” ​ I freeze. How does he know that? The windows, I think. I turn
      around, bracing myself as I look straight ahead at the windows of the
      buildings across from us. ​ Nothing. No one. Just rain and darkness and
      thunder and the occasional flash of lightning. “I mean, you sound
      precious,” he says. I clear my throat. “That’s kind of you to say. How can
      I –” Click. ​ This is not normal. I switch my call taking status to
      offline and look around the room. I scoff at myself when I realize I can’t
      actually see anyone. Our cubicles are designed to keep us focused on work.
      If we need help, we can message each other. If we can’t wait, then we can
      ask for help from the person next to us. I don’t want to bother Carol. She
      might think it’s the serial killer. I doubt it, but I can’t deny I’m on
      edge… I glance in the direction of Aidan’s office. Should I mention it to
      him? I don’t want to look paranoid or needy. After a few minutes, Aidan
      comes by my cubicle. “Do you have a minute?” he asks with a smile. His
      office is spacious. The window behind him offers no light at the moment,
      but it’s still bright inside. Everything is so clean and neat, unlike my
      cubicle that has yellow Post-it notes everywhere and a pile of books
      stacked high in one corner. “I forgot to discuss your raise. I know you
      won’t be starting now, but I figure you should have a heads-up on what
      you’ll be earning.” It’s a nice raise. More than what I was expecting. I
      accept without hesitation. “Are you sure?” he asks, eyebrows raised in
      surprise as if he was expecting me to negotiate for more. “Yes,” I say,
      smiling. He grins. “Excellent! We can –” The lights go out again. This
      time, it was without warning. Aidan groans as I stand. “Should I head
      back…,” I trail off. “No! Please stay here and make yourself comfortable.”
      He turns on his phone flashlight. “There is candy in there,” he says,
      pointing to the ornate container near the corner of his desk, “and water
      bottles in the fridge.” He angles his phone toward the mini fridge. I turn
      on my phone flashlight as he stands and walks to the door. When he’s gone,
      thunder claps so hard that my chest reverberates and lightning flashes so
      bright that it illuminates his office for a second. I yelp and drop my
      phone, backing into his desk at the same time. The candy jar teeters then
      falls to the ground. The lid opens and candy spills everywhere. ​ “Great,”
      I mutter. ​ I bend down to pick up my phone then proceed to gather all the
      candy. Somehow, some pieces have slid underneath his desk. I place the
      pieces I’ve already picked up on his desk and crawl around the corner.
      “Found you,” I mutter. As I reach for the first piece of candy, something
      in my peripheral vision catches my eye. I glance up. There are photos
      taped to the underside of his desk. Without really thinking it through, I
      grab the photos and peel off the tape. ​ When I take a good look at the
      first photo, my heart stops beating for a moment. It’s one of the serial
      killer’s victims. ​ I recognize her because it’s the same photo the news
      showed. I turn the photo over and see neat handwriting. I shine my
      flashlight on the words. ​ Keep or kill? Kill. ​ The photo of the next
      victim says the same. And the next. All five victims have the same
      question and answer. Except for the sixth one. It’s my badge ID photo. A
      chill runs through me when I turn it over. I lose feeling in my
      fingertips. For the second time, my phone clatters to the ground. The
      photos fall out of my hand. The rhythmic pounding of the rain grows louder
      and louder until it’s a blur and all I can hear is screaming and police
      sirens and Aidan’s voice, low and calm and raspy, whispering in my ear. ​​
      Keep or kill? Keep.
